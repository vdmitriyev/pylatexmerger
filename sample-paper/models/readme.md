### About
Current folder contains model for publication.

### How
Models are done in MS Visio 2010.
To convert from EMF to EPS metafile2eps.exe is used.

NOTES:
	-	In order to create proper EPS files, the models from VSD must be saved as *.EMF in to the EMF folder;
	-	'PNG' and 'EMF' file can be saved automatically by the means of macros:
		-	Method 'ExportOnlyCurrentVSOToPNGandEMF' saves 'PNG' and 'EMF' only from the currently active VISIO file;
		-	Method 'ExportAllVSOToPNGandEMF' saves 'PNG' and 'EMF' from all VISO files that are located in the current directory;
	-	To convert from 'EMF' to 'EPS' manually script "_convert.bat" can be used(heavily relies on "metafile2eps.exe" utility);
